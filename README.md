# Python Facial Recognition

A repo of practice with Python's Facial Recognition library. Some of this is done with terminal commands in a virtual environment.

### Usage

- Make sure that you have the most up to date version of Python and the package manager pip installed.
- Make sure that you have `pipenv` installed by using `pip install pipenv` from the terminal.
- Use command `pipenv shell` to start virtual environment.
- Once working in the virtual environment, run command `pipenv install face_recognition` (If there is an error during installation, run `pip install cmake`, and then run command `pip --no-cache-dir install face_recognition`).
- Happy coding!~
